# Protekt documentation

This repository contains the official documentation site for **Protekt**, a cloud-based authentication platform.  
The site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20.0 or later (v18+ may also work, but v20 is recommended)  
- npm or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/activus-d/Protekt-documentation.git
cd Protekt-documentation
yarn
# or
npm install
```

## Local development

Start the development server:

```bash
